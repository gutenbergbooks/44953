<h3>A COLLOQUY IN CLOUDLAND.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
SCENE&mdash;<i>Cloudland, nigh to midnight of the last day of the Old Year.
The Incomparable Sage of Fleet Street and "La Mancha's Matchless Knight"
mounted on their respective wooden horses.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> (<i>spurring the Spotted One</i>). Yoicks! Tallyho!! Hark
forward!!! Something like space-consuming
speed this, eh, my dear Don? Who talks now of a Horseless Age?</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote</i> (<i>turning the peg of Malambruno's magic steed</i>). Only
your scientific and sensational journals, who,
dryasdust dogs! are, after all, endless leagues behind Merlin the Enchanter, and
the magic-aided heroes of old romance.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Kim up, my timber-built timber-topper, and spotted
space-devourer! As though the much-talked of
motor-carriage, auto-cycle, or petroleum-propelled tram-car of these mouthing
days of modernity might compare with the
Trifaldi's steed, my spotted Pegasus, or even the peripatetic carpet of Persian
story! Speed you well, valorous knight!</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> Heaven guide thee, undaunted Sage! Hah! How you fly aloft!
How you cut the air more swiftly
than an arrow!! How you mount, and soar, and astonish the world below!!!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Haha! Ours is no imaginary, bellows-blown flight, as was
yours, worthy knight, when seated with
<span class="sc">Sancho</span> on the wooden crupper of Clavileno, pressed aforetime by the
valourous <span class="sc">Peter</span> of Provence, and the fair <span class="sc">Magalona</span>!</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> Nay, indeed, Sir Knight of the Spotted Bucephalus&mdash;for thou
art no chivalry-scorning <span class="sc">Trifaldi</span>&mdash;we
are not now blindfolded, and <i>thy</i> Pegasus, <i>thy</i> Brilladoro,
<i>thy</i> Bayarte, <i>thy</i> Frontino, <i>thy</i> Clavileno el Aligero&mdash;or
Wooden-Peg
the Winged&mdash;might give a lead even to my renowned Rosinante!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Blindfolded? Nay, dear knight, I am the Dazzling Illuminator,
not the Bewildering Blinder!</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> I plainly perceive that thou art a Progressive.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> I am a Progressive Moderate and a Moderate Progressive. Badge
me not therefore in any less comprehensive
fashion, O Knight of the Rueful Countenance.</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> I presume, Sir Sage, that those same Progressives, however,
who claim to initiate all the forthright
movement of the Age, did originate and invent the motor-carriages, auto-cycles,
and other the horseless locomotive vehicles
of which we spake but now?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Who better than yourself should know, my dear Don, that all
are not Progressives who make a stir about
Progress? Like the circumgyrators in the game of "Giant's Stride," many of them
ramp round in a circle, and "get no
forrader." <i>I</i> am the only true and trustworthy Progressive, and my
auto-motor cuts <i>all</i> records!</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> And is it propelled by petroleum?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> By nothing so crude, flaring, and fuliginous, dear Don. It is
"motived" by&mdash;<span class="sc">Light</span>!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>[pg iv]</span></p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> Wondrous machine! How would I like to mount it! Is it in
likeness of a horse?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Say not the witlings and wiseacres that we are on the verge of
a Horseless Age?</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> They do. But, by the bones of my beloved Rosinante, the idea
liketh me not. The horse is indeed a
noble animal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> And will continue to be "useful to man," our current
cyclo-and-auto-motormania notwithstanding. The
cycle doubtless hath its utility, and even charm, though in certain of its
characteristics it seems qualified to give mankind the
hump!</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> And womankind the wobbles!</p>

<p class="side"><i>Mr. Punch.</i></p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p> When lovely woman stoops to wheeling,</p>
<p class="i2"> And finds too late that bikes betray,</p>
<p> Beauty, and grace, and finer feeling</p>
<p class="i2"> She'll see the sex hath chucked away!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> Verily, had my peerless <span class="sc">Dulcinea</span> herself
bestraddled a spinning-wheel in ungraceful posture and unseemly
garb, I, her sworn knight, should have deemed her the victim of diabolic
enchantment. Why, even the afflicted
duenna, with her fair cheeks beard-begrown by enchantment, she whom
<span class="sc">Sancho</span> called the Countess Three-Skirts, would not&mdash;save
under dire compulsion&mdash;have donned the modern divided skirt and mounted the
man-saddled steed of steel. Art
sure, Sir Sage, that after all it is <i>not</i> enchantment that hath so far
unsexed your afflicted damosels and duennas, and that
'tis not my duty in their defence to lay lance in rest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Nay, sweet soul of chivalry, Mayfair is not La Mancha, and you
may safely leave its fair denizens to the
defence&mdash;or, if need be, chastening&mdash;of that knightly lance of to-day, my own
invincible and unerring <i>bâton</i>. But, verily,
'twere a punishment not ill-deserved by certain of our mannish maidens and
male-mimicking matrons did <span class="sc">Malambruno</span> clap
bristly scrubbing-brush hairs upon them as upon your distressful Duenna of
Toledo.</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote.</i> Verily, Sir Sage, we are mounting skyward, dawn-ward, New
Year-ward in a wondrous manner! Thy
spotted steed is surely Pegasus itself, for Skyworld is full of myriad voices of
wisdom and melody.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> But my Auto-Motor, comparable only with the Sun God's glowing
chariot, shall outsoar and outshine
even our present empyrean flight.</p>

<p><i>Voice</i> (<i>suddenly sounding behind them</i>). Wuff! Wuff! Wuff!</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote</i> (<i>looking round</i>). Saints preserve us! What is this new
marvellous enchantment? Hath Sirius itself
broken loose?&mdash;doth the Dog Star follow our trail?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> What seest thou, Sir Knight?</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote</i> (<i>with awe</i>). I behold, as it were, an aerial
fire-wheeled car, shapen in the guise of a Titanic Tome,
coruscating comet-like in its career, whereon is mounted&mdash;yes, verily&mdash;a Dog&mdash;a
Dog of Dogs! What, Sir <span class="sc">Punch</span>, may be
this portent?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Why, my dear <span class="sc">Don Quixote</span>&mdash;who seems scarcely the
Quixote Quicksight of the nursery rhyme&mdash;what
<i>should</i> it be but <span class="sc">Tobias</span> himself with that promised specimen of
my Auroral Autocar, or Mirific Motor-Carriage, self-impelled,
self-steered, self-lighted, self-heated, the most peerless outcome of the true
Progressive spirit, the true acme of sure and
speedy Progress; in other words, dear Don, and at your entire service, my</p>

<h3>A PATH OF PEACE.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>The Baltic Canal, June 22, 1895.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">["Peace reigns over the whole fleet," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>"Daily News" Special.</i>]</p>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A work of Peace, whereto from near and far</p>
<p>Gather the iron-bosomed brood of war,</p>
<p>Like new Stymphalian birds, whose claws and wings</p>
<p>The warrior welcomes and the poet sings.</p>
<p>Oh, gentle Peace, how strange in our strange day.</p>
<p>Thy mailèd retinue, thine armed array!</p>
<p>Those flower-deck'd obelisks, that silken rope,&mdash;</p>
<p>Bright illustrations of the Tales of Hope,&mdash;</p>
<p>The royal speeches and the loyal cheers,</p>
<p>Disguise misgivings as they silence fears.</p>
<p>But Denmark's memories, and the thoughts of France,</p>
<p>As through the stream that yacht's white bows advance,</p>
<p>Breaking that slender cord from bank to bank,</p>
<p>Might move reflections strange. Yet let us thank</p>
<p>Adventurous skill which gives our ships to-day</p>
<p>A shorter passage and a safer way!</p>
<p>Not war alone, but trade, will take the track</p>
<p>That shuns the wild and stormy Skager Rak;</p>
<p>And may Brunsbüttel's now familiar name</p>
<p>Be little linked with Empire's big War-Game</p>
<p>May battle-echoes in the Baltic cease,</p>
<p>And the Canal be a new Path for Peace</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Our B. A. (<i>i.e.</i>, "Baron's Assistant") begs to congratulate Mr.
<span class="sc">Gerald Campbell</span> very heartily on the success of <i>The Joneses and the
Asterisks</i> (<span class="sc">John Lane</span>). It is no easy task to write a story in a
series
of what may be called monological dialogues,&mdash;dialogues, that is to
say, in which only one party speaks while the rest are understood,&mdash;and
yet to keep that lightness of touch and that sparkle of wit
without which dialogues become mere barren boredom. This is the
task that Mr. <span class="sc">Campbell</span> has brilliantly accomplished. <i>The Joneses
and the Asterisks</i> is as keen and telling a piece of social satire as it
has been the B. A.'s good fortune to come across for many a long day.</p>

<p>Thursday. June 27, Mid-day. The Baron opens ventilators, doors,
windows. Then, at haphazard, he takes up a book. Its title, <i>What
is heat?</i>... Answer immediately given by thermometer, "95° in
the shade." That's heat! And if that isn't, what is? The second
title of book is, <i>A Peep into Nature's Most Hidden Secrets</i>. But
the Baron is not <i>Paul Pry</i>; he doesn't want to peep; at all events he
cannot undertake any exertion until about November, say, when he
will be delighted to peruse the work of Mr. <span class="sc">Frederick Hovenden</span>,
F.L.S., F.G.S., F.R.M.S.,&mdash;"Three single Fellows rolled into one."
"Let me descend to the ice-cellar, or in cool grot let me sit,
with a soothing iced beverage and a choice Havannah; let me
read there <i>About the North Pole</i>, and <i>Gunter's Tales of Ices</i>,"

<h2>THE CANDIDATE'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> Why do you desire to enter the House of Commons?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Because, if I am honoured by my fellow-men by being
chosen to represent them, it is my ambition to serve them faithfully
and maintain in all its glorious integrity the time-honoured heritage
of this mighty empire.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Yes, so you have said in your address to the electors; but have
you no other reason for wishing to occupy a seat in Parliament?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly. The prestige bestowed by the letters "M.P." is
pleasing, and if the honour ultimately culminates in a baronetcy or a
knighthood the distinction will be gratifying to my wife.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you would not be adverse to receiving promotion in the
line to which you have referred?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; because I should consider that I acted merely as a trustee
to my constituents&mdash;that I, in fact, appeared in the character of their
personal representative.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Yes, you said something of the sort the other evening at a
canvassing meeting in reply to a question put to you by one of your
voters; but surely the decoration would be desirable for some other
consideration?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It undoubtedly would have a certain market value in the City
in the eyes of promoters of public companies of limited liability.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What measures have you taken to secure election beyond
issuing the very admirable address to which I have, more than once,
referred?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> For the last two or three years I have assiduously nursed the
constituency.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What do you mean by nursing a constituency?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Obtaining a stake in the shape of land and a house in the
division, and making myself generally popular amongst my fellow-ratepayers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How can you become popular?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> By subscribing largely to local charities and institutions,
laying foundation stones, and opening fancy bazaars with untiring
energy.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What considerations weigh with you when you are invited to
add your name to a subscription-list?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I take care to make the sum I give a little larger than that
contributed by my opponent, and take it as a general rule that lawn
tennis is of more importance than dispensaries, and polo, from a
benevolent point of view, takes precedence of associations established
to relieve dire distress.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there any other method which may be adopted with advantage
by those desirous of nursing a constituency?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Speaking frequently in assembly rooms, taking nursery
gardens for the same purpose, and generally improving trade in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then the money paid for the hirings to which you refer is
commercially popular?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is, and (joined of course to the eloquence of my friends and
myself) should distinctly influence the election.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And should you be elected, what do you suppose you will have
to do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To thoroughly enjoy the honour of being able to treat the House
of Commons as a club, and being asked by the leaders of my Party
to all their entertainments. I shall see my name in every newspaper
report when I have happened to take part in a popular function. I
shall find that I have mounted the social ladder by leaps and bounds,
and be able to pleasurably patronise or cut direct those who now
become my inferiors.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And what consideration will support you in your general
demeanour?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The conviction that all I do, and have done, is and has been
actuated by the purest patriotism.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE SOMALIS AT SYDENHAM.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">In the Stables.</span></h4>

<p><i>Miss Simplicia Simpson</i> (<i>looking at the native saddles on
brackets</i>). I suppose those are what they put on the ostriches!</p>

<p><i>Her Companion.</i> They don't <i>ride</i> ostriches.</p>

<p><i>Miss Simpson</i> (<i>in a tone of pity and reproof</i>). That only shows
you've never read your <i>Swiss Family Robinson!</i></p>

<p><i>A Gobe-mouche.</i> Well, I never see a white lamb with a black 'ed
before; that <i>is</i> a curiosity, ain't it'?</p>

<p><i>His Phlegmatic Friend.</i> Not arf such a curiosity as if it 'ad 'ad a
black 'ed be'ind.</p>

<p><i>A Censorious Lady</i> (<i>before a row of baby elephants</i>). Oh,
<i>aren't</i>
they horrid! Look at their horrid little eyes. (<i>As one of them protrudes
a predatory trunk.</i>) Oh, get away, <i>do!</i> They are <i>the</i> most
hideous creatures I've <i>ever</i> seen! <i>Look</i> at that one, all wrinkled
and baggy like an old man. See, it's wagging its head about like
a Chinese doll! I do think they're <i>quite</i> loathsome, don't you?</p>

<p><i>Her Companion</i> (<i>a more Tolerant Person</i>).
I daresay they would'nt look so bad if they
were varnished up a bit.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">In the Ostrich Farm.</span></h4>

<p><i>The Keeper</i> (<i>who apparently considers his
Show as moral as</i> <span class="sc">Artemus Ward's</span>&mdash;<i>to the
Public generally</i>). I've came over here From
California, whose golden waters kiss The
mouth of her Sunny Sands, and where there
air strawberries all the year round. On the
farm where I live there were only fourteen
days in all of lasst year when we had no
strawberries. The most Glorious climate In
the World; and, if anyone don't believe it,
all they've got to <i>do</i> is to die; and then, if
they've been good, they'll go there, and find
out for themselves. I'm not under Con-tràct
To say a single word here, but I want to talk
to you about these birds, because they're
generally misunderstood. They walk en-tirely
From the Toe, which gives them the graceful,
springy action you see. They air all named
after the greatest people now living on airth.
This one close to the rails is called <span class="sc">Jim Blake</span>.
Mark well the Peculiarities, Life, Habits, <i>and</i>
Characteristics of the Ostrich, and you will all
of you go away And lead A moral life. The
only absolootly Purrfect Being on This ole
Universe is the bird now passing in front of
me. Her name is <span class="sc">Gail Hamilton</span>, and She has
The Smallest Feet of anyone here present, <i>and</i>
the Smallest Head. She has only one ounce of
brains inside of it, and that is Sufficient for
her requirements, and nobody would have any
use for more if they did not suffer From swelled
heads.... Yes, little girl, you're purrfectly
right&mdash;the ostrich <i>does</i> run zig-zag, which is A
Fact that is Unknown to many Scientific men.
The kick of the ostrich is as quick as lightning&mdash;<i>quicker</i>
'n lightning, be-cause you can
see lightning, but you <i>cann't</i> see an ostrich's
kick, which is four kicks to the second, and
kills a man every time. At certain seasons
it is Impossible to go among these birds except On horseback, and
pro-vided with a stout pole with a fork at the end for Self-defence.
All of these birds are here on Sale, and there is a large demand for
them for Gentlemen's Parks and Country seats.</p>

<p><i>A Suburban Humourist</i> (<i>to his</i> Wife). What d'ye say to gettin' a
pair on 'em fur our back-yard, eh?</p>

<p><i>His Wife.</i> 'Ow you <i>do</i> tork, <span class="sc">'Enery</span>! 'Oo do <i>you</i>
suppose is goin'
to 'ang the washing out with two o' them great houtlandish beasts
lolloping around? Not <i>me</i>, and so I <i>tell</i> yer. I've enough work on
<i>my</i> 'ands without no austridges!</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>She fans herself violently with her programme, and</i> <span class="sc">'Enery</span> <i>is reduced
to explain that his suggestion was not seriously intended.</i></p>

<h4><span class="sc">In the Stands&mdash;during the Native Display.</span></h4>

<p><i>Mrs. Keyveve</i> (<i>to her brother</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">Frederick Frivell</span>,
<i>as the
Somalis are performing a marriage dance</i>). It seems a curious kind
of wedding, doesn't it, <span class="sc">Fred</span>? Can you make out which are the
bride and bridegroom?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Frivell.</i> Fancy that's the bride in red cotton, with her hair
down, prancing with maidenly gaiety between the first bridesmaid
and the best man, while the bridegroom, becomingly draped in a
bath-towel, may be observed capering up and down clapping hands
with the officiating clergy. A simple but impressive ceremony.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Keyveve.</i> Very. I wonder if they get any wedding presents.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Frivell.</i> Rather. The sportsman in the rusty wig gave 'em
<span class="sc">Browning's</span> poems and an afternoon tea-kettle, and the Johnny with
the feathers in his wool presented her with a dressing-bag. The
photo-frames, card-cases and carriage-clocks are all laid out in one of
the huts, according to the savage custom of the country, guarded by
a detective in the disguise of a wedding guest, armed with poisoned
spears.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Keyveve.</i> How silly you are! Look, they're rolling along a
great wicker-basket. What <i>can</i> they have in it&mdash;the bride's luggage,
perhaps?... Why, it's an enormous snake! See, it's crawling
out!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Frivell.</i> It's the bride's going-away dress, that's all. Someone
ought to tell her that boas aren't worn this season, though.</p>

<p><i>'Arriet</i> (<i>in the Sixpenny Promenade, to</i> <span class="sc">'Arry</span>). What are
they
miking all that row about&mdash;are they supposed to be <i>torking</i>, or what?</p>

<p><i>'Arry</i> (<i>vaguely</i>). I expect they're declarin' war&mdash;against
<i>somebody</i>
or other.</p>

<p><i>'Arriet</i> (<i>reflectively</i>). I wonder if that little bit of 'air
stickin' up
grows out of that feller's 'ed like that. Look
at all them little nippers runnin' about&mdash;(<i>with
an air of discovery</i>)&mdash;I expect they <i>belong</i> to
some of 'em.</p>

<div class="foo">
<p>[<i>The Somalis perform a war-dance, which
seems to consist in squatting down opposite
one another in a double row, chanting
"Razza-Ho! Ho-hoâ-ho-ho!" or words
to that effect, while two of the party dodge
between the ranks and cluck like poultry,
after which all rise, knock their wooden
shields together until they lose further
interest in the affair, and stroll away
satiated.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Keyveve.</i> Is that really their war-dance?
It's very much the same as the
<i>marriage</i> dance, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Frivell</i> (<i>a contented bachelor</i>). Yes;
subtle beggars, these Somalis.</p>

<p>"There they <i>are</i>, yer see&mdash;Comin' 'Ome from Southend!"</p></div>

<p><i>'Arry</i> (<i>during the Sham Fight</i>). 'Ark at one

"Olla-olla-olla!"&mdash;he's sayin' the other bloke

didn't you know <i>that</i> much?</p>

<p><i>'Arriet.</i> Oh, you're so partickler, <i>you</i> are!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Keyveve</i> (<i>during the Dromedary Race</i>).
<i>How</i> seasick one must feel on those wobbly
camels!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Frivell.</i> The Camel has been beautifully
called the "Ship of the Desert."</p>

<p><i>A Husband</i> (<i>confidentially, to his neighbour</i>).
Yer know, the Missus ain't <i>enjoyin'</i> all
this, <i>she</i> aint&mdash;you see. I'll arsk her, and
you 'ear what she sez. (<i>To his</i> "Missus.")
'Ow d'yer <i>like</i> it, eh, Mother?</p>

<p><i>His "Missus"</i> (<i>with self-repression</i>). Oh&mdash;middlin'.</p>

<p><i>Husband</i> (<i>insistently</i>). Ah, I know what <i>that</i> means; yer
don't
<i>care</i> about it. Now, <i>do</i> yer?</p>

<p><i>His "Missus."</i> It's well enough&mdash;in its way. (<i>With irrepressible

<p><i>Husband</i> (<i>to his neighbour, with a mixture of chagrin and
complacency</i>).
Didn't I <i>tell</i> yer? That's where it is. I don't know a

<p><i>Miss Simpson.</i> Look at those dear ostriches running after one another

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Small by Degrees and Beautifully Less.</span>&mdash;Our excellent contemporary
the <i>Northern Whig</i> allows a correspondent to call
attention to the nuisance of cycling in Malone Park. Apparently
our "fellow-subjects of the sister kingdom" have followed the lead
of "the beginners of Battersea," and "made themselves a source of
annoyance to the majority of people resident in the locality." If
"the nuisance" is permitted, the correspondent suggests the Park
will soon be deserted. When this happens, the cyclist can appropriately
alter his ride (by cutting off a letter) around Malone to Alone.</p>

<h2 class="sans">OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/005-1000.png"><img src="images/005-400.png" width="400" height="298" alt="Zerlina Patti accompanied by her Squire on the violoncello." /></a>
<p class="center">Zerlina Patti accompanied by her Squire on the violoncello.</p></div>

<p>Another two "turns" and <span class="sc">Patti</span> is off. Delightful to see and
hear her as <i>Zerlina</i> in immortal Opera <i>Don Giovanni</i>. "<i>Patti
Patti</i>" with "<i>Batti Batti</i>," "<i>La ci darem</i>," and all old friends
admirably given and heartily encored. After one of the encores
<span class="sc">Maggie Macintyre</span> walks off suddenly as if in search of lost
pocket-handkerchief. In most serious moments ever a twinkle
in <span class="sc">Maggie's</span> eye, and twitch at the corners of <span class="sc">Maggie's</span> mouth,
as if giving audience clearly to understand that she is "only
purtendin'."</p>

<p>Second Act. Enter <span class="sc">Patti</span>; sings, pauses; wonders; sings note,
like nightingale summoning mate; pauses; again wonders. "Some
one had blundered!" <span class="sc">Bevignani</span> beaming but bothered. "He
cometh not," they said. Exit
<span class="sc">Patti</span>, shrugging shoulders.
Curtain drops. Very short Act.
Audience, amused, applaud.
Curtain up again. <span class="sc">Bevignani</span>
brightens. Re-enter <span class="sc">Patti</span>
with merry <i>Masetto</i>, who privately
explains that for a few
moments he had lost his voice
and had been looking for it.
Fortunately, voice found; in
chest; quite safe. Surely a
little modern dramatic polish
might be used to furbish up
utterly idiotic old-fashioned
stage-business of this ancient
Italian Opera? Eh, Signor
<span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>?</p>

<p>In the trio at end of Act II.
somebody got off the line,
and audience, determined that
they would be better for a
little more practice, called
Ma'am <span class="sc">Adini</span>, Miss <span class="sc">Maggie</span>,
and Master <span class="sc">Brozel</span> before the
curtain, and then made them
go through their exercise once
more. Nothing like practice, to make perfect.</p>

<p>The Statuesque <i>Commendatore</i> to be highly commended as represented
by aristocratic <span class="sc">Manners</span>. New Italian Opera proverb "Manners
makes the Commendatore." <span class="sc">Patti</span> at premium. Royalty
Restored to Box. Brilliant night. Crammed, jammed house.</p>

<p><i>In Lobby.</i>&mdash;Much agitation among ancient Opera-goers on hearing
report that <span class="sc">Mario</span> is to sing here on Saturday afternoon.
"<span class="sc">Mario!</span>"
they exclaim; "impossible!" Not at all: it turns out that <i>this</i>
"<span class="sc">Mario</span>" is a character in a new Opera by "<span class="sc">Alick Maclean</span>"
(pretty name, but nicer if it were "<span class="sc">A Wash Meclean</span>"), entitled
<i>Petruccio</i> (not <span class="sc">Shakspear's</span> <i>Petruchio</i>), in which one
<i>Mario</i>
is "<i>Elvira's little brother</i>;" and so, possibly, he was quite an
infant when sister <i>Elvira</i> was cruelly treated by <i>Don Giovanni</i>.
Also in this new Opera appears "<i>Elvira's mother</i>." In fact, it is
rather lucky for <i>Don</i> that he has gone below with Stony
<i>Commendatore</i>
to Stony Stratford, or elsewhere, as the talented
<i>Elvira</i> family, with whom is associated <i>Rubino</i>, a gentleman
"formerly betrothed to <i>Elvira</i>," would make it rather too hot
for him.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Glück's</span> <i>Orfeo</i>. "Gen'lm'n," if overtaken with
wine,
as was <i>David Copperfield</i> on a notable occasion, would say, "G'luck
t' you," that is, could any gentleman in such state be possibly admitted
to Covent Garden, and
could dare to address <span class="sc">Julia
Ravogli</span>, admirable as <i>Orfeo</i>,
<i>Cavalleria</i> to follow.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Madame <span class="sc">Sembrich</span>
nice as <i>Violetta
Traviata</i>, "were t'other dear
charmer away!" Very hot
night. <span class="sc">Mancinelli</span> must for
once have wished himself a
non-conductor? Result, <span class="sc">Mancinelli</span>
Melted.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<i>Adelina Zerlina
Patti-cake</i> and the Im-Maurel
<i>Don G.</i> Why not in such
hot weather give opera with
ice in it; <span class="sc">Patti</span> in skates "<i>en
Patti-neuse</i>."</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Welcome to
Madame <span class="sc">Albani</span>, our <i>Valentine</i>
in what <span class="sc">Wagstaff</span> calls
"<i>Lay Hug-me-nots</i>." "Not
bad title," he explains; "after
crowd of ecclesiastics in swearing
scene, pleasing to find two
principal characters are 'lay':
not 'lay-figures' but lovers
not permitted by hard Fate either to embrace each other or
any opportunity of eloping together; so '<i>Hug-me-not</i>' curiously
applicable." So far, <span class="sc">Wagstaff</span>. Strong cast this with <span class="sc">Giulia
Ravogli</span> as <i>Urbano</i> the page of music, <span class="sc">Melba</span> as
<i>Margherita</i> the
Queen with the top-notes in her air; <span class="sc">Jupiter-Plançon</span> as <i>Marcel</i>,
<span class="sc">Tam Agno</span> as <i>Hug-me-not Raoul</i>, and <span class="sc">Ancona</span> as <i>Conte de
Nevers-say-die</i>.
Conducting orchestral army to victory, Marshal <span class="sc">Mancinelli</span>
is Merry and Meritorious.</p>

her Modiste.</i> <span class="sc">Time</span>&mdash;<i>The passing hour.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Modiste.</i> No, Madame, it is utterly impossible
for you to wear silks and satins. They
have quite gone out.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> But hasn't alpaca come in a little?</p>

<p><i>Modiste.</i> Scarcely. It may be used for
divided skirts at Battersea Park, but it is not
really recognised.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Then what am I to wear?</p>

<p><i>Modiste.</i> Flowers, Madame, flowers. Of
course they should be fixed on foundations,
but they are the only materials used at the
present time.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Are they not rather expensive?</p>

<p><i>Modiste.</i> Well, no. I shall not charge more
for them than velvet or brocade. And, of
course, if you choose to wear your dresses
more than once, your maid can get them renovated
with new flowers at an almost fabulous
reduction.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> I do not think a gown ever looks well
when worn a second time.</p>

<p><i>Modiste.</i> Quite so, Madame; quite so.
Well, would you like a charming dress of
pink hyacinths, with bishop's sleeves of
Gloire de Dijon roses? The skirt would be
of variegated lilac.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> But could you get the material for
the floral combination?</p>

<p><i>Modiste.</i> Oh dear yes, Madame! Since the
fashion for real flowers has come in we are
supplied daily from all parts of the world, and
have a large stock always at hand on the premises.
Why, our greenhouses are the finest
in London. Will you want any other costume
to-day?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Only one for a small dance to-morrow.
I want something cool and quiet.</p>

<p><i>Modiste.</i> You can scarcely do better than
wear a costume <i>d'Eden</i>, or as it is facetiously
termed in England, "a dress for <span class="sc">Eve</span>." It
is an arrangement in oak leaves and apples <i>à
la mode de la première femme du monde</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Very well. Let me have it home by
eleven.</p>

<p><i>Modiste.</i> You can depend upon my punctuality,
Madame. If you are careful not to
dance too much it will last until 2 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, and
permit of your partaking of supper. I would
not say this with confidence of all the gowns
I turn out, but in this instance you will find
leaves stronger than flowers. And now,
Madame, permit me to take your measure.</p>

<h3>AFTER THE CONGRESS WAS OVER.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>A Strange Fragment dealing with a Mystery.</i>)</p>

<p>Every important question that could be
considered had been thoroughly examined
and decided. The delegates, who had come
from North, South, East and West, had expressed
their satisfaction with everything
they had seen in London. As for the British
Empire generally, their admiration knew no
bounds. "It was magnificent." "It was
beautiful." "It was grand." And yet when
they prepared to take their departure there
was a shade of disappointment upon their expressive
countenances.</p>

<p>"I wish I could have understood it," said one.</p>

<p>"It would have been a triumph of ingenuity
to have comprehended it," observed another.</p>

<p>"The queries of the Egyptian Sphinx were
the easiest of conundrums in comparison,"
added a third.</p>

<p>And others chimed in to the same effect.
But to the very last the delegates tried their
best to solve the problem. At length the
company departed. The hall in which the
great assembly had been held was empty.
There was one striking object in the deserted
apartment. It was a book&mdash;a yellow-covered
book. Evidently it had been much read.
But, in spite of the fingering, there was no
distinct evidence that the full meaning of its
contents had been grasped by anyone.</p>

<p>In the quiet of the night the moonbeams
illuminated the title-page.</p>

<p>The volume that rested so securely with its
knowledge carefully concealed between its
paper covers was <i>Bradshaw's Railway
Guide</i>.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p><span class="sc">Who Wouldn't be an Alderman?</span>&mdash;I have
often wished to be an Alderman, and, after
reading the following extract from the <i>Birmingham
Daily Gazette</i>, I have fixed upon
West Bromwich as the scene of my aldermanic
labours. It must be glorious to joke with
such ease:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<span class="sc">A West Bromwich Alderman's Joke.</span>&mdash;Yesterday
morning when the West Bromwich
guardians entered the Board Room at the West
Bromwich Workhouse, the blinds were all drawn,
and as a consequence the room presented a very
gloomy appearance. The business was about to
be commenced, when Alderman <span class="sc">R. Williams</span>
objected to the blinds being lowered. He inquired
whether their lowering had a political significance,
and whether the house was in mourning
for the death of the Radical Government. If his
assumption was true he considered they should
not commence the business until the blinds were
raised (<i>Laughter.</i>) Two of the largest blinds
were then raised, but six others were allowed to
remain down."

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p>Some of us like our English short, others prefer it expanded.
Some of us, for instance, might say that "<span class="sc">Nero</span> fiddled while Rome
burnt." But this bald statement is obviously quite unsuited to the
decorative instincts of the age, for in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, only last
week, I read that "a notorious Roman Emperor is credited with the
performance of a violin solo during the raging of a serious conflagration
in the heart of his capital." The omission of <span class="sc">Nero's</span> name
gives to this sentence a delicate parliamentary flavour, which brings
it absolutely up to date.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>But what a noble example it is! Henceforward, for instance, if it
should ever fall to my lot to write about <span class="sc">Henry the Eighth</span> of
England, I shall feel a mere fool if I state that he married seven
wives. No, no. A British monarch, celebrated in the books of the
historians as the Eighth, and hitherto the last of his name, is reported,
on the authority of the Ecclesiastical registers of his time, to
have entertained so warm and overpowering an affection for the connubial
condition commonly known as matrimony, as to have entered
into it with a comparatively light heart on as many occasions as
would equal the sum total of predecessors bearing his name who
have supported the burden of the crown of these realms. For a very
slight increase of salary I am prepared to double the length of this
sentence without adding a single fact to it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Here, too, is a delightful extract from a gorgeously illustrated
volume issued by a firm of house-agents in praise of what they very
properly term "an imposing structure in red brick." "It is difficult,"
they declare (and after reading their description one can well
believe it) "to conceive a more replete Town Mansion, embodying
such artistic and delicate schemes of decoration, one where wealth has
wrought such a revelation of harmonious and fitly fitments, or
where the studious consideration of the minutest detail contributing
to health, enjoyment and comfort has been more completely manifested.
This, combined with its advantageous position removed from
any main thoroughfare with its accompanying turmoil, renders it a
perfect dwelling and an idealistic London Home."</p>

<p>Next let us contemplate a pure gem of descriptive English from a
sporting contemporary. It occurs in an account of the athletic contest
between Cambridge University and the United Hospitals:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Scarcely a cloud flecked the blue heaven yesterday afternoon, and a
dazzling sky burnished the Stamford Bridge grounds into an acre of reflected
sunshine. What a pleasant spot the tryst of the premier athletic club on
which to hold athletic revels! It was not to be expected that the people
would show a front at the carnival. So much to do nowadays, what with
cycling at Hurlingham, and the Beauty wheel show on the Row in Battersea
Park. Equal to the occasion though proved many English girls, and it was
pleasing indeed to note their presence in the pavilion and enclosures. Bold
as Britannia as a rule in this, the nineteenth century. And don't forget this,
innocent as a posy all the while.... Think of this now. <span class="sc">W. Mendleson</span>
(C.U.A.C.), but by birth a New Zealander, figuratively speaking, gazed
on the ruins (long jump ruins, of course) of Britishers at Stamford Bridge.
It was with a quickened pulse that one watched the Hurdle Race. 'Pon our
soul 'twas a difficult problem to solve a few steps from home to tell which
would win, <span class="sc">Pilkington</span> or <span class="sc">Lowe</span>. The flag went up for the visitor from the
banks of the Cam. Nevertheless, no one can assert but that the medical
banner remained hoisted at the truck in honour of their representatives.
Gallant seconds!... Of course <span class="sc">H. A. Munro</span> gave us a taste of his quality
in the Three Miles. Verily he ran as though able to keep up pacing from
sunrise to sunset. 'Twas a glorious victory that he gained. Neither must
the plucky bid made by <span class="sc">Horan</span> be forgotten. Ah! if he had only been
<span class="sc">Munro</span>! But he wasn't, so there was no use in thinking about that.
</p></blockquote>

<p>How melancholy are these might-have-beens. If <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> had
only been <span class="sc">Wellington</span>. But he wasn't. So there was no use in
thinking about that.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Henley</span> Regatta, I understand, is to be an international festival
this year. A Dutch crew has entered for the Thames Cup, but it is
not stated that they carry a broom in their bows. Nor is it to be
inferred that they will make a clean sweep of the prize. Besides
many English crews they will meet a crew from France. Then from
Toronto come four Argonauts sailing not for the Golden Fleece, but
for the Stewards' Challenge Cap; and from Ithaca, N.Y., eight
modern Trojans, undergraduates of Cornell University, have set out
intent on the capture of the Grand Challenge Cup. To all of them
<i>Mr. Punch</i> extends the right hand of good fellowship, though,
being British to the backbone, he cannot wish for their triumph over
his own gallant oarsmen. And amongst these he especially welcomes
Mr. <span class="sc">C. W. Kent</span>, the Hero of Leander, who, having four times
stroked his crew to victory, is once more seated on the slide of honour
to defend possession of the Grand,&mdash;<span class="sc">Kent</span>, the pride of joyous Moulsey,
whom at his birth the Fates endowed with the triple gifts of cunning,
resource and courage, bidding him wield an indomitable oar in undefeated
crews. As when a fox, emerging from the tangled covert&mdash;&mdash;But
I cannot pursue the Virgilian method any further. Let the event
next week speak for itself. Here's luck all round, and may the
best crew be an English one. In any case, may the best crew win.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The gentlemen from Cornell have brought over with them, in
addition to their boats and oars, a terrible battle-cry, "Cornell, yell,
yell, I yell Cornell." Manifestly the members of the London Rowing
Club cannot model themselves on this, for to cry, "London, done,
done, I'm done, London" would, I trust, be as inappropriate as it
would certainly be discouraging.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>My recent investigations into the condition of some of our great
provincial cities lead me to the depressing belief that something is
always wrong with some of their streets. Here, for instance, is
"<span class="sc">Nemo</span>" writing to the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> to complain that
"on Saturday evening the Bury New Road was filthy, whilst the
odour was equal to that of the Ship Canal, but different. Formerly
there seemed to be an effort made to have the road brushed up on
Friday ready for Saturday and Sunday, when thousands of well-dressed
and happy people&mdash;Jew and Gentile&mdash;promenade it on their
way to breezy Kersal Moor." But why, may I ask, should there be
no well-dressed and happy Christians promenading on their way to
Kersal Moor? It may be that they have followed "our local representatives,"
who, "<span class="sc">Nemo</span>" suggests, "are enjoying their holidays,
or are immersed in golf," which I take to be a delicate euphemism
for bunkered.</p>

<h3>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h3>

<p>Is it well to temper justice with jokes?
This important question has been settled in
the affirmative in many courts of law, but it
has been left for his Honour, Judge <span class="sc">Edge</span>, to
use his own name (instead of somebody else's)
in the playful manner requisite to excite
"laughter in the Court." A solicitor recently
took upon himself to argue with his Honour
in the Plymouth County Court a question of
costs in respect of a case heard some months
since. He conducted his argument with much
warmth and inaccuracy. This combination
of bad law and bad temper enabled the Judge
to score an easy victory. "Stand down,"
said his Honour; "if you play with edged
tools you must pay for it." Thus triumphed
the Law and the Judge, and once more "unquenchable
laughter arose amongst the blessed
gods" up in the gallery.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>The British earthquake has been sadly
neglected. Therefore Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Davison</span>,
M.A., F.G.S., of Birmingham, is writing a
<i>History of the British Earthquakes of the
Nineteenth Century</i>. With a view to add to
the completeness of this work, he has appealed
to the readers of the <i>Western Daily Mercury</i>
for "notices of British earthquakes, either
past or future, of any kind and from any
place whatever." He specially desires to become
acquainted with earthquakes "of which
descriptions appear in the local press, or entries
are made in private diaries." All local papers
should at once start a special earthquake
column&mdash;"Earthquakes Day by Day," or
"Yesterday's Earthquakes"&mdash;and writers of
diaries would do well to dive into the past.
There are so many remarkable phenomena not
otherwise recorded. Here is one. "Dined
with <span class="sc">Brown</span> last night. Insisted on walking
home, instead of taking <span class="sc">Brown's</span> advice and
a cab. Had not gone far when strange thing
happened. Pavement suddenly upheaved and
hit me violent blow on forehead. Fell prostrate.
Taken home in dazed condition by
friendly policeman. No time to observe affect
of earthquake on adjoining houses. Shock
very short, but exceedingly severe. In bed
all day. Large bruise on forehead. Headache,
&amp;c." There must be many interesting entries
of this kind in diaries which will afford valuable
material for Mr. <span class="sc">Davison's</span> work. As
to "notice of future earthquakes," which he
requests, perhaps the Meteorological Office,
the Geological Society and Zadkiel will
kindly oblige with probable dates and other
information.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p><span class="sc">Wizard And Wittles.</span>&mdash;Long life to the
Glasgow Sir Walter Scott Club! It "promotes
the study of Sir <span class="sc">Walter's</span> life and
writings, and encourages a more familiar
acquaintance with the localities rendered
classic by his pen." Ninety members set off
the other day to Edinburgh, and drove in four-in-hands
to the "beechy grove" at Melville
Castle, the Esk and <span class="sc">Drummond's</span> Hawthornden,
and then on to the castle and chapel at
Roslin. Lunch at Dalkeith, dinner at the
Balmoral Hotel at Edinburgh, and back rejoicing
at eventide to Glasgy, "after the
happiest and most successful excursion in
the history of the club." This is the way to
keep up the dignity of literature. Far better
than knighthoods! An excursion "under the
presidency of the genial Sheriff <span class="sc">Spens</span>," too;
no Sheriff <span class="sc">Saves</span> <i>this</i> time; and a dinner at
the Balmoral to wind up&mdash;it's a Talisman
to make the heart of Midlothian leap up!</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p><span class="sc">A Musical Treat. A Pronouncement
and a Hint.</span>&mdash;Herr <span class="sc">Nikisch's</span> performance
is so brilliant, and has so much real fire in it,
as to have given rise to the suggestion that,
to express the <i>diablerie</i> of his effects, both
syllables of his name should be short, and
that his style should be henceforward known
as the "Old Nickish" manner. When the
chance recurs, go and hear the symphony by
<span class="sc">Tschaikowsky</span>. Only be prepared. To pronounce
this name correctly you must take
pungent snuff and sneeze violently while trying
to utter the word "Whisky." Take care
to have a medical man ready at hand; also a
tailor, with needle, thread, and buttons.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 24.</i>&mdash;Back to-day from the
booming Baltic to wan Westminster. Given up the company of Kings
and Queens which formed Don <span class="sc">Currie's</span> daily fare; descended to level
of Commons. And what a state of things to come back to! Left
less than a fortnight ago, with House in almost comatose
state. Even the Busy B's had ceased to hum. <span class="sc">Tanner</span> no
longer disturbed at hour of midnight by poignant curiosity
as to when the Dook would retire. <span class="sc">Silomio</span>, his head bandaged
after latest buffeting by <span class="sc">Edward Grey</span> and <span class="sc">Sydney
Buxton</span>, temporarily silent. <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> for awhile
content with management of House by "my right hon.
friend the <span class="sc">Chancellor of Exchequer</span>." In a moment,
in the twinkling of <span class="sc">St. John Brodrick's</span> eye, crisis and
chaos come. Ministry blown up with charge of cordite,
surreptitiously brought in; concealed under Front Opposition
Bench; fired in the dinner hour.</p>

<p>"Cordite?" said <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>. "What is this cordite
they're all talking about? Thought it was something they
made trousers of."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Private <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, up in all military
matters. "You're thinking of corduroy."</p>

<p>House crowded from furthest bench of side galleries to
gangway steps on floor. A buzz of excitement completes
fulness of chamber. Only two empty seats. These on front
benches, where <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> and <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>
were wont to face each other. <span class="sc">Joseph's</span> seat below gangway
filled by <span class="sc">Courtney</span>, who, in honour of occasion, has put on a
white waistcoat and a smile. Wears both throughout proceedings.
A loud cheer welcomes arrival of <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>
looking graver than usual. Three minutes later another rings
forth, and the <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> enters with slow step and
countenance set, suitable to the obsequies of an assassinated
Ministry. <span class="sc">Jesse Collings</span> comes in; startled by cheer from
Irish Members.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Joe's</span> not far off," said <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>, grimly. "In times
like these sends <span class="sc">Jesse</span> on ahead, like the pilot-engine that
goes before <span class="sc">Czar's</span> train. If there were any murderous plot
on hand, by <span class="sc">Justin McCarthy</span> or any other brigand, the
blameless figure of <span class="sc">Jesse</span> would be blown into space, and
<span class="sc">Joseph</span> would proceed on his journey with his hair unsinged."</p>

<p>On stroke of half-past three <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> made
formal announcement of familiar fact that Government had
resigned; <span class="sc">The Markiss</span> had been sent for; Ministers kept
their places only till their successors were appointed.</p>

<p>"I would ask leave to say," the <span class="sc">Squire</span>, with unwonted
tremor in his voice, observed, bringing to close his brief,
business-like speech, "that for every man who has taken part in
the noble conflict of Parliamentary life, the chiefest of all ambitions,
whether in a majority or in a minority, must be to stand
well with the House of Commons."</p>

<p>How in this respect the Leader of the House through two Sessions
of peculiar difficulty stands with both tides, testified to by a
ringing cheer, repeated when <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, who always does
these things well, voiced the common feeling as he recognised in the
blushing <span class="sc">Squire</span> "one of the greatest ornaments of this House."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said the <span class="sc">Squire</span>, when I offered
him
my congratulations on deliverance from a situation long become intolerable.

Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, master of himself though Ministers fall,
proceeds to discuss as calmly as if nothing had happened. Whilst
other Members already have their eyes on their constituencies and
their faces towards the door, <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, buttonholing Time as it were
with his hooked arm, leisurely discusses the close season for Seal
Fishing.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;The Government's.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;House met again, expecting further particulars about
the Ministerial crisis. Benches full, but not so crowded as yesterday.
Again the <span class="sc">Squire</span>, <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, and <span class="sc">Joseph</span> absent.
The
two latter not expected. When they reappear they will sit side by
side on Treasury Bench. But where was the <span class="sc">Squire</span>?</p>

<p>Preliminary business finished. House waiting for next move.
Must be made by <span class="sc">Squire</span>. Where was he? Members tossed about
on seats. All eyes strained towards space behind <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> chair,
whence Ministers approaching Treasury Bench emerge. Minutes
passed; <span class="sc">Squire</span> still tarried. Horrible rumour that cordite had
done fresh stroke of work. <span class="sc">Frederick Milner</span> said he distinctly
heard sound of explosion in neighbourhood of room of Leader
of House. Another report was that <span class="sc">Squire</span> had been kidnapped,
shipped off to distant colony by direction of new <span class="sc">Secretary of
State</span>. Whilst probability of these wild guesses balanced, <span class="sc">Squire</span>
entered, whole and hale. Had been waiting to hear from <span class="sc">The
Markiss</span>. Nothing had come, so must adjourn.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;House adjourned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span></p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;All settled: <span class="sc">Squire</span> announces that <span class="sc">Markiss</span>
has undertaken to form new Ministry. Writs moved for elections to fill
vacancies consequent on acceptance of office. Amongst them West
Birmingham, <span class="sc">Joseph</span> having undertaken to care for the Colonies.
Prospect of "Our <span class="sc">Joe</span>," as <span class="sc">Sage Of Queen Anne's Gate</span>
affectionately calls him, sitting in Cabinet Council with <span class="sc">The Markiss</span>, strangely
moves House. Irish Members in particular give vent to feelings in
cries that forebode lively times for new Minister.</p>

<p>House lost crowded appearance of earlier days of week. Interest
already transferred to constituencies. <span class="sc">Gorst</span> among absentees.
<span class="sc">Sark</span>
looking for him everywhere. Been reading article in magazine where
<span class="sc">Gorst</span> writes:&mdash;"A lady resident in East London informed me that
she once knew a man who was attending fourteen doctors at the same
time. The man died."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/012a-700.png"><img src="images/012a-200.png" width="200" height="372" alt="Cap'en Tommy Casabianca Bowles." /></a>
<p class="title1">Cap'en Tommy Casabianca Bowles.</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Sark</span> wants to know what was the matter with the doctors? Why
the man was attending them? And whether this is cited as case of
overwork, or of death resulting from infectious disease?</p>

<p>The worst of <span class="sc">Sark</span> is that his curiosity is almost feminine in its
intensity.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Foundation stones of new Ministry laid.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Thursday.</i>&mdash;Quite a crowded House. <span class="sc">The
Markiss</span>, not seen
in his place since he
became Prime Minister,
now there
faced by <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>.
Large attendance
and eager interest
explained by attempt
to purloin
Seals of <span class="sc">Secretary
of State for War</span>.
In dim and distant
future this likely
to rank with the
Diamond Necklace
Affair. <span class="sc">Sark</span>, who
has been reading
Radical newspapers
on incident, tells me
all about it.</p>

<p>As soon as Vote
of Censure passed
on <span class="sc">Cawmell-Bannerman</span>,
<span class="sc">Markiss</span>
became possessed
of uncontrollable
passion for instant
possession of his
seals of office. How
was it to be done?
<span class="sc">Cawmell</span> a Scotchman;
not easy to
get loose property
out of his grip.
<span class="sc">Markiss</span>, instinct
with influences of
spacious times of
Queen <span class="sc">Elizabeth</span>,
not to be trifled
with. Clapped his
hands. Enter
faithful henchman,
one <span class="sc">Schomberg</span>. A
stoutly-built man
of herculean strength, bowed legs, grizzled beard, short thick
hair like hand-spikes standing up above pair of ears resembling
nothing so much as Tower Bridge when, in opening, either
flap stands out at angle of forty-five degrees. A certain piquancy
given to his features by front tooth protruding like tusk of wild
boar.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Schomberg</span>," said <span class="sc">The Markiss</span>, hoarsely, "I want
<span class="sc">Cawmell-Bannerman's</span>
Seals. His address is 6, Grosvenor Place, S.W. He
comes home late, with a latch-key. Take twenty stout fellows, as
like yourself as the country produces. Await his coming. Take
the Seals. If he resists, a slit weasand will scarcely be noticed in a
population of (according to the last census) 4,349,166. <i>But bring
the Seals.</i>"</p>

<p>That is <span class="sc">Sark's</span> idea of the episode after reading the papers. <span class="sc">The
Markiss's</span> version differs in some details.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">The Markiss</span>, challenged by <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>,
says new
Ministry have no policy at present. However, since <span class="sc">Rosebery</span> seems
anxious on point, will send over to <span class="sc">Whiteley's</span> and see what can be
done.</p>

<h3>A DISCOVERY IN LIQUEURS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;You remember <i>Mr. Squeers's</i> system of theoretical and
practical
teaching, "'<i>W-i-n-d-e-r-s</i>.' Go and clean 'em"? Of course
you do; and if the quotation is not letter perfect, it is its "spirit,"
which is more suited to my present theme, at all events. Well, Sir,
"them's my principles." Accordingly, after reading your advice
as to taking a Summer Sunday trip to Calais and back by <i>Calais-Doûvres</i>,
or one of the large boats in L. C. and D. service, I acted
upon it, and went. The <i>trajet</i> was simply perfect! Such weather!
Sea so calm! Breeze refreshing! Company distinguished! Commander
<span class="sc">Wattelbled</span>, and First Lieutenant <span class="sc">Carini</span>, with all hands,
waiting to give us (at a price as fair and moderate as the Channel
breeze on this occasion) excellent refreshment. But to sing their
praise is not my point; they do their duty, and pay it too, as we
<i>voyageurs</i> have to do, on cigars, teas, and tobacco. I had time to
refer to hotel's list of wines and liqueurs, and among the latter there
appeared a name which brought tears to the eyes of the wanderer
far from his English home; and that name, Sir, coming after
"Kümmel, and Marasquin, and Whisky," was "<i>Old Tom-Gim</i>"&mdash;"Tom
Gi<i>m</i>" with an "m." How far superior to "Gin" with an "n."
It brought to mind early days of catechism, "<i>M. or N., as the case
may be</i>." This was a case of liqueurs. How preferable the soft liquid
"<i>m</i>" to the less soft "<i>n</i>" in making "<i>Gin</i>" into "<i>Gim</i>"!
And
how much one would like to alter the spelling, and make it "<i>Old
Tom Jim</i>." Would he not be seized upon by a French librettist as
the very name, <i>par excellence</i>, for a typical Ancient English Mariner
in an opera? Don't you see it? "<i>Capitaine</i> John Smith; <i>First
Mate</i> Old Tom Jim" with song (nautical). <i>Vive</i> Gim! Now, with
my discovery, I regain the good ship, and, once aboard the lugger ...
by the way, there is an eighteen-penny tax now levied by the
French on those who land at Calais. "<i>Happy Thought.</i> Don't
land." But, <i>Unhappy Thought</i>, if we don't land in the
<i>pas-de-Calais</i>,
the result will be <i>pas de déjeuner</i>. So&mdash;"bang goes sax-pence,"
for "We don't kill a pig every week."</p>

<p class="author1">Yours,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">Thomas le Vieux</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;And another one-and-sixpence extra on landing at Dover!
All the "fun of the fare," eh?</p>
